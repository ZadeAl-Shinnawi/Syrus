To create a window, you first need to initialize GLFW, its version, and mode.
Then, you can create a window, error check it, and set its context to current.
Next, in order to use any OpenGL functions, we must initialize GLAD. After
that, we set the OpenGL viewport. We must also create a window resize callback
function that triggers anytime the window is resized. We also set up an input
processing function that, for now, just checks if the window should be closed.

The render loop looks like this: process input, render, handle events.
One iteration of the render loop is called a frame.
